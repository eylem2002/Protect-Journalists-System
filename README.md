how we can protect jounalist ?!!! 


Protect Journalists Project, is a watch and a tag that is made especially for journalists to help them to be safe and protected, mainly in critical and serious conditions like wars. The journalist will be tracked by the foundation he works to. As a result, they will help exactly on time when they need it.

Moreover, all parties involved in the war will be aware of the location of the press, in order not to obstruct their presence in any dangerous way, in an official capacity, after signing international treaties not to use this tracking in the wrong way. Journalists will be able to ask for any health service by pressing on the watch, and their health records will be provided to the nearest hospital such as blood transport or any Allergy to certain substances. Furthermore, both watch and tag will be waterproof and canâ€™t be easily damaged, so in any condition, both will help the journalists to be safe as possible as could be.
